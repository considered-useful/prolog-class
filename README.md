# prolog-class
This repo contains info about me and my interest in prolog.  I can hopefully manage to put solutions to exercises in here also.

## why did you sign up?
I was introduced to prolog through the book [Seven Languages in Seven Weeks](https://pragprog.com/book/btlang/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks).  I went through a bit of [Learn Prolog Now](http://www.learnprolognow.org) independently, but thought it'd be more productive to learn with the help of others, so I signed up.

## what are you hoping to get out of this?
Having read about some of the industrial applications, I'm hoping that I will get a good productivity tool for problem solving, so it will be interesting to see if I can apply anything I learn here to my day job as a c++ programmer.  But I'm also just curious to go through the course, connect with others and see if I see programming any differently afterwards.

## is that it?
I might grab a few useful links from the slack channel and stick them in some separate markdown.
